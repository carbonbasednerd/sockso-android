TODO List:

* Use layout @include tag to group common views widgits for list items and other layouts

* Implement remaining buttons on player UI:
  - Playlist
  - Shuffle
  - Repeat
  
* Add placeholder images for cover art

* Create audio file cache for music

* Create a better "first-start" workflow for initial sync of music library

* Implement syncing mechanism (requires server-side changes)
  - How to handle "delete" operations?

* Fix player to pause & resume when system detects a phone call

* Move cover art image retrieval to ContentProvider

* Fix memory issue with loading images in listview while "flinging" (scrolling really fast)

* Player does not seek properly when streaming from a url (fails if seek position is past mp buffer)
  - Consider custom class to download and stream track from file instead of letting mp handle it
  - Is there a way to tell how full the buffer is?
